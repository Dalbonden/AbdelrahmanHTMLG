🔥 Welcome Texts for Freaky Fashion Site / Brand 🔥
1. "Welcome to the Closet of Chaos."
Strap in, unzip reality, and wear your weird. You’re not here to fit in—you’re here to mutate the mainstream.

2. "You just stepped into the style asylum."
No rules. No trends. Just raw, unfiltered drip straight from the deep web of your dreams.

3. "Fresh out the fashion lab."
Toxic threads, stitched in madness. One size fits no one—perfect.

4. "👁️ Welcome to FREAKMODE."
Where fabric meets fever dreams. Warning: May cause side effects like too much style and existential swagger.

5. "You’re not lost. You were summoned."
This isn’t fast fashion. This is forbidden fashion. Stay weird, shop strange.
